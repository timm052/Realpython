# Compare values

# -------------------------------
# Example 1
# -------------------------------

# Boolean logic is the is the way computers store data and refer to
# anything that can only take one of two values True or False
# for purposes of additon:
# True  = 1
# False = 0
print(42 * True + False)
print(False * 2 - 3)
print(True + 0.2 / True)


# -------------------------------
# Example 2
# -------------------------------

# in order to evauate expressions and determine if they are true or false
# we need a way to compare values using a set of Symbols
# a	>  b  -  greater than
# a <  b  -  less than
# a >= b  -  greater than or equal to
# a <= b  -  less than or equal to
# a != b  -  a not equal to b
# a == b  -  a equal to b
print(1 > 2)
print(1 < 2)
print(1 != 2)
print(1 == 2)


# -------------------------------
# Example 3
# -------------------------------

# Strings can be compaired in the same way as numbers < or >
# is not that useful but we can use == or != to see if strings
# are the identical or not.
print("dog" == "cat")
print("dog" != "cat")
print("dog" == "dog")

print()
