# Summary
# You should use lists when:

# 1. You have a mixed collection of data,
# 2. The data needs to be ordered,
# 3. The data may need to be changed (lists are mutable), and
# 4. You need a stack or a queue.


# You should use tuples when:

# 1. The data won't need to be changed (tuples are immutable), and
# 2. Performance is an issue.


# You should use dictionaries when:

# 1. There is a logical association between a key/value pairs,
# 2. You need to lookup data quickly (via keys), and
# 3. The data may need to be changed (dictionaries are mutable).
