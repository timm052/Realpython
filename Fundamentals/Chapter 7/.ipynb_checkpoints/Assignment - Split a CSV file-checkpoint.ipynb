    "# Assignment: Split a CSV file\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script that will take three required command line arguments - `input_file` ,\n",
    "`output_file` , and the `row_limit` . From those arguments, split the input CSV into\n",
    "multiple files based on the `row_limit` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments:\n",
    "1. `-i` : input file name\n",
    "2. `-o` : output file name\n",
    "3. `-r` : row limit to split\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Settings:\n",
    "1. `output_path` is the current directory\n",
    "2. headers are displayed on each split file\n",
    "3. the default delimiter is a comma\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example usage:\n",
    "`# split csv by every 100 rows`\n",
    "\n",
    "`>> python csv_split.py -i input.csv -o output -r 100`\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start coding, stop for a minute and read over the directions again. If you're\n",
    "having trouble following them, take some notes. What makes this assignment so difficult\n",
    "is that it has a number of moving pieces. However, if you can break them down into\n",
    "manageable chunks, then the process will be much easier. Let's look at it together.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You first need to grab the command line arguments. I recommend using the\n",
    "argparse library for this. Once obtained, you should validate the arguments to\n",
    "ensure that (a) the input file exists and (b) the number of rows in the input file is\n",
    "greater that the row limit to split. Make sure that each of your functions does only\n",
    "one thing. Think about how many functions you need for this first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the validation passes, the program should continue. If not, the program ends,\n",
    "displaying an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next you need to split up the CSV file into separate \"chunks\" based on the\n",
    "`row_limit` argument. In other words, if your input CSV file has 150 rows (minus the\n",
    "header) and the `row_limit` is set to 50, then there should be three chunks (and \n",
    "when you create your output CSV files, each chunk will have 50 rows + the header).\n",
    "There's a number of different ways to create each chunk. In this example, it's\n",
    "probably easiest to create a separate list for each chunk containing the\n",
    "appropriate # of rows from the input CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You need to have separate output files (one for each chunk) that have some sort of\n",
    "naming convention that makes sense. You could use a timestamp. Or you could\n",
    "add the chunk number to each file name - e.g., output-file-name_chunk-number.csv.\n",
    "Each file must have a .csv extension as well as the headers. Add each chunk to the\n",
    "appropriate output file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, output information to the user indicating the file name and the # of rows for\n",
    "each chunk. Format this in an appropriate, legible manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try this out on your own before looking at the answer. You should be able to get through\n",
    "the first two steps on your own. The remaining steps are a bit more difficult. If you found\n",
    "this assignment easy, try to add additional functionality to your program, such as the\n",
    "ability to include or exclude the headers from each file, splitting the input CSV by the\n",
    "column # (or name) instead of by row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Need help? Here are some recommendations for how to break down steps 3, 4, and 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "In step 3, you should open the CSV file and create a list of lists where each list is a row\n",
    "in the spreadsheet. Remove the header and save it, since you'll need to add it to each\n",
    "chunk. Use a `for` loop to loop through the list of lists and create a chunk that contains\n",
    "the rows from a starting row # to an ending row number. The ending row number is the\n",
    "`row_limit` . If there are not enough rows left - e.g., the rows remaining is less than the\n",
    "`row_limit` - then make sure to add all remaining rows to the final chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 4 and 5 are best kept in the same `for` loop. Create a new, unique output file\n",
    "name, add the headers to each chunk, then add each chunk to the file. Output the\n",
    "information to the user.\n",
    "\n",
