    "Write a script high_scores.py that will read in a CSV file of users' scores and display the highest score for each person. The file you will read in is named scores.csv and is located in the chapter 9 practice files folder. You should store the high scores as values in a dictionary with the associated names as dictionary keys. This way, as you read in each row of data, if the name already has a score associated with it in the dictionary, you can compare these two scores and decide whether or not to replace the \"current\" high score in the dictionary.\n",
